# Portfolio

This is a portfolio website for me, **LAYTH**, to represent my **Career Goals**, **My Studies**, **My Interests**, and **My Projects**.

As I am not a web developer, I have not built it from scratch â€” I have used **(Gemini 2.5 Pro, ChatGPT)** in order to make it.  
I think there are improvements to be made, especially in the **UI/UX**.

If anyone is an expert and wants to help make this project better, **do not hesitate to contact me**:
